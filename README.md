# Alexander Blair's SSG

## Translate Markdown code into usable HTML
This Static Site Generator will generate HTML code that can be viewed in the browser from a base file.

## No Installations Necessary
This is a browser application written solely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so there are no installations required outside of your browser. 

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository in your directory of choice
2. Open "ssg.html" with your browser of choice
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate your code from a file
4. Save the generated code as an HTML file or copy it as a snippet into your project

## Customization:
- Currently, only meta tags are supported as a custom addition to the HTML code

## Notes:
- This was created as a browser application due to an assumption that one who does not understand HTML code may not understand the CLI.
- It does not create a full HTML document in one step to allow those who would like to use the generated code as a snippet, rather than an entire document.
- The CSS is unnecessary, and only there to improve readability. This application will work with just "ssg.js" and "ssg.html"

## Supports:
- Markdown

## Issues
- HTML code snippets written in the base file do not render correctly
